# Fuzzy Fusion of Deep Learning based Text Classification
A hybrid fuzzy deep learning approach for classification of Covid-19 related tweets.

- It uses three classifiers based on pre-trained BERT, RoBERTa, and Covid-Twitter-BERT models. 
- Two fuzzy fusion methods are used an ensemble: (1) Fuzzy rule-based method, (2) Fuzzy Choquet integral
